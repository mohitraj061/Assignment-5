    "Ques 3.) What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is the way they store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Structure :\n",
    "    \n",
    "* List : A list is an ordered collection of items where each item is identified by its position or index. Lists maintain the\n",
    "  order of elements as they are inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary : A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique within the dictionary, and it\n",
    "  is used to access its corresponding value. The order of elements in a dictionary is not guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Data Access :\n",
    "    \n",
    "* List : In a list, data is accessed by its index position, starting from 0. For example, my_list[0] retrieves the first item\n",
    "  in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary : In a dictionary, data is accessed using keys. Each key in the dictionary maps to a corresponding value.\n",
    "  For example, my_dict['key'] retrieves the value associated with the key 'key'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Mutable vs Immutable :\n",
    "    \n",
    "* List : Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created. You can modify the\n",
    "  values at specific indices or use methods like append(), remove(), insert(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary : Dictionaries are also mutable. You can modify, add, or delete key-value pairs in a dictionary. You can change\n",
    "  the value associated with a key, add new key-value pairs, or remove existing key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Usage :\n",
    "    \n",
    "* List : Lists are useful for storing an ordered collection of items, especially when the order of elements is important. \n",
    "  Lists are commonly used when you want to work with a sequence of items or iterate over them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary : Dictionaries are ideal when you want to associate values with unique keys and need fast access to those values.\n",
    "  They are used to represent mappings or relationships between different entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lists are ordered collections accessed by indices, while dictionaries are unordered collections accessed by keys.\n",
    "Lists are suitable when maintaining the order of elements is important, whereas dictionaries are useful for quick access to\n",
    "values based on unique keys."

    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we try to access spam['foo'] and spam is {'bar': 100}, it will raise a KeyError.\n",

    "    \n",

    "The expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys() check for the presence of the key 'cat' in the dictionary spam, \n",
    "but they have a slight difference in their behavior:\n",
    "\n",

    "exists among those keys. It returns True if the key is present and False otherwise. It checks for key existence within the \n",
    "list of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical difference between these expressions lies in their performance and behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'cat' in spam directly checks for key existence in the dictionary without generating a separate list of keys. It is \n",
    "generally more efficient because dictionary key lookups are highly optimized for performance. This approach is preferred when\n",

    "\n",
    "*'cat' in spam.keys() retrieves all the keys in spam and creates a list of keys before checking for the presence of 'cat'.\n",
    "Generating the list of keys may require additional memory and time, especially for large dictionaries. This approach \n",

    "specific key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, 'cat' in spam directly checks if 'cat' is a key in the dictionary spam, while 'cat' in spam.keys() generates a \n",

    "while the latter is useful when we also need to work with the list of keys."
